/**
 * Per-lead/deal email activity — "mail received" vs "replied" — aggregated
 * client-side from the core `Communication` doctype (the same one `EmailPanel`
 * reads/writes), filtered to CRM Lead/Deal references. Demo-scale data, so a
 * single bulk fetch + client-side group-by is simpler and cheaper than N
 * per-record queries.
 *
 * Communication's own reference field is `reference_name`, not
 * `reference_docname` (unlike CRM Task/Note/Call Log/Event Participants,
 * which all use `reference_docname`) — confirmed against the live backend:
 * filtering/selecting `reference_docname` here silently returned nothing.
