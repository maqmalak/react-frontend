# crm-setup.sh — post-install CRM setup for this project's production Frappe
# site. Sibling to install.sh (initial provisioning) and update.sh (code
# deploy — frontend rebuild + micromax app pull/migrate/build); this script
# is neither of those — it's CONFIG/DATA, applied directly against the site
# via `bench console`, independent of what code is currently deployed:
#
#   1. Mail  — an Email Account (IMAP + SMTP), with the corporate domain
#              always used as the From/sender address (avoids shared-hosting
#              mail servers rejecting outgoing mail for a From-header domain
#              mismatch — see the "always_use_account_email_id_as_sender"
#              setting below).
#   2. Role  — a "CRM" role with full (read/write/create/delete/print/email/
#              report/export/share/import) access to every CRM-app doctype
#              (Lead, Deal, Task, Note, Call Log, Organization, ...) plus the
#              mail/WhatsApp/notification doctypes the CRM UI depends on
#              (Communication, Email Template, Contact, Address, Event,
#              Notification Settings/Log, WhatsApp Message/Log/Template/...).
#              Email Account / WhatsApp Account / WhatsApp Settings get the
#              same access minus Delete, since those hold the mail/WhatsApp
#              credentials configured in step 1 — the role can use and
#              reconfigure the integration but can't delete the account
#              outright.
#   3. User  — a login with the CRM role assigned, plus "Sales Manager" and
#              "Sales User" (needed for reasons beyond DocPerm — see below),
#              password set directly (no welcome email — this is meant for
#              servers with no outgoing mail configured yet, or an operator
#              setting the password by hand).
#   4. Contract — widens the core Contract doctype's party_type/document_type
#              Select options to accept CRM Lead/Deal/Organization (Property
#              Setter — Frappe validates a Select's value against its
#              declared options server-side, so the React form's dropdown
#              alone isn't enough), and widens CRM Notification's type Select
#              to include "Email" (needed by the mail send/receive
#              notifications — see micromax/crm_mail_notifications.py and
#              crm_reminders.py's _notify_mail_send_status, deployed via
#              update.sh's REMOVE_APPAREL=1 path since that's actual app
#              code, not something this config-only script touches).
#   5. Email Template — adds the `crm_template` Custom Field, which the CRM
#              Email Templates page and the Lead/Deal compose box's template
#              picker both filter/select on. Without it: "Field not
#              permitted in query: crm_template" the instant either loads.
#   6. CRM Task — adds the `task_category` Custom Field (Task/Follow-up), so
#              the Tasks page, the Follow-ups page, and the Lead/Deal detail
#              page's own "Tasks" vs "Follow-ups" cards each show only their
#              own bucket instead of every CRM Task record on both — without
#              it, a task/follow-up created anywhere shows up duplicated on
#              every one of those lists, since they all read the same
#              underlying CRM Task doctype with no way to tell them apart.
#
# Why Sales Manager/Sales User too, not just the custom CRM role: the
# vendored crm app registers its own permission_query_conditions hook for
# CRM Lead/CRM Deal (crm.permissions.org_hierarchy) that restricts visibility
# to records the user owns or is assigned to, UNLESS their roles include
# System Manager, or Sales Manager while not present in the CRM Sales
# Hierarchy doctype. A custom role's Custom DocPerm access — no matter how
# permissive — does not satisfy that check, so a user with only the CRM role
# would see zero Leads/Deals and be unable to tell why. Core Frappe has a
# similar trap for Communication (email): without "Super Email User" or
# System Manager, get_permission_query_conditions_for_communication hides
# EVERY email-type Communication unless the user has a matching "User Email"
# account mapping — symptom: "No emails yet" on a Lead/Deal that has real
# email history. "Super Email User" isn't seeded on this bench by default,
# so this script creates it if missing.
#
# Run as root (same as install.sh and update.sh) — it sudo's to the frappe
# user internally, same PATH-forcing helpers as those two scripts:
#
#   sudo EMAIL_PASSWORD='the-mailbox-password' \
#        CRM_USER_PASSWORD='the-login-password' \
#        bash crm-setup.sh
#
# Every value below can be overridden the same way (SITE_NAME, APEX_DOMAIN-
# derived defaults, etc.); only EMAIL_PASSWORD and CRM_USER_PASSWORD are
# required (no hardcoded default — pick real passwords per deployment).
# Idempotent — safe to re-run any time (e.g. after rotating the mailbox
# password, or after update.sh deploys a micromax change this script's
# config depends on): every step here updates the existing record instead of
# duplicating it.
